Topological nodes change as the current network state changes (i.e., switches, breakers, etc. change state).</Comment><Comment>For a planning model, switch statuses are not used to form topological nodes. Instead they are manually created or deleted in a model builder tool. Topological nodes maintained this way are also called "busses".</Comment><SuperType name="IdentifiedObject"/></ComplexType></Catalog>
